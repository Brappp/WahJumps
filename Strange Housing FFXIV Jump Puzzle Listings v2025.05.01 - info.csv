,Difficulty Ratings: Setting General Expectations,,,
,"Ratings are designed to give the challenger a general idea of what to expect, and won't always coincide with personal experience: sometimes it will feel harder and sometimes it will feel easier.",,,
,Rating,Original System Rating,Star Diagram and Explanation,Square-Enix Equivalent
,1★,Beginner,"★☆☆☆☆ - Designed to be as easy as they come, with pure Skill focus and light application of other Sub-types; mostly everyone can clear",Cliffhanger GATEs; Fall of Belah'dia & Falling City of Nym GATEs
,2★,Medium,"★★☆☆☆ - Offers a solid challenge to most players, possibly simple for veteran jumpers; more complex mechanics and jumps present",Kugane Tower; Sylphstep GATE
,3★,Hard,"★★★☆☆ - ""Party Finder Bounty"" difficulty, extremely tough for most players with full range of mechanics possible; still a challenge for vets",Second half of Moonfire Tower (Only available during event)
,4★,Satan,★★★★☆ - An extremely broad difficulty that encompasses the most difficult courses; veterans will find a vast range of difficulties here,"Very top of Moonfire Tower (""toothpick"" section) is borderline 4★ (without using bomb platforms near the top)"
,5★,God,★★★★★ - Reserved for the hardest of the hard; designed to obliterate challengers,Square-Enix isn't sadistic enough to make these
,P,Training,"☆☆☆☆☆ - A puzzle meant to instruct or introduce certain techniques, or provide a space to practice these techniques",
,E,Event,"☆☆☆☆☆ - A puzzle built specifically for an event, usually only open a few days at a time",
,T,Temp,☆☆☆☆☆ - A puzzle that is temporary or only open for a limited time; may close permanently or be replaced with another build eventually,
,F,In Flux,"☆☆☆☆☆ - A puzzle that undergoes considerable, gradual change rather than remaining static like most puzzles",

,Sub-type Keys: Know What Skillset to Bring,,,
,"Sub-types can seem overwhelming at first, but they can provide information about what skillset you'll need to bring for success. Please note that higher difficulty puzzles may not always reveal needed techniques!",,,
,Code,Element,Means the puzzle:,More Info
,M,Mystery,"has hard-to-find or maze-like paths, furniture combinations with hard-to-solve interactions; tricky, misleading, or deceptive elements",M+ can signify Mystery complex enough to greatly affect the difficulty rating
,E,Emote,has points where /sit or /doze interactions with furnishings are required to cross gaps or walls; these points can be hidden,"E+ indicates that emotes will trigger furniture movement (""slides""), potentially locking you out and forcing a re-entry to reset"
,S,Speed,"makes you wait on Sprint cooldown due to early or multiple long jumps, only applies when jumps are near/beyond max Peloton range",Combat this by bringing extra speed buffs such as Expedient (Scholar) or Moon Flute (Blue Mage)
,P,Phasing,uses furnishings you need to run straight into until they let you pass through them; Phasing is often banned so check puzzle rules!,"P+ requires Jump Phasing (""Forbidden Tech"") to prevent phasing through what you're standing on"
,V,Void Jump,has vertical gaps that can only be crossed using a void jump and are required to complete the puzzle,A void jump is performed by running straight over the void for a second before jumping underneath your desired landing
,J,Job Gate,"has gaps that can only be crossed using specific job abilities, i.e. En Avant, Elusive Jump, Aetherial Manipulation, Hell's Ingress/Egress, etc","J+ requires a specific job such as Blue Mage for Co-op puzzles, or when only certain job abilities will navigate gaps"
,G,Ghost,has furnishings that disappear and reset in a predetermined order,G+ has multiple stages of Ghost that will disappear and reset in predetermined orders
,L,Logic,employs the above mechanics in unconventional ways that redefine what a jump puzzle truly is; can be viewed as a modifier for the other tags,L+ requires deep understanding of techniques that may be used together to create significant obstacles to solve
,X,No Media,is subject to a no streaming/recording request from the builder for any number of reasons,"Some builders prefer to keep a low profile or keep their puzzles mysterious, please respect their wishes!"
